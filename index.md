I'm a Process Control Engineer at the [Burnaby Refinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnaby_Refinery). I graduated with a degree in [Chemical Engineering](http://chbe.ubc.ca) from UBC Vancouver ([BASc '17](https://apsc.ubc.ca/spotlight/siang-lim)). My hobbies include writing [good (-ish) code](https://github.com/csianglim) and drinking excessive volumes of coffee. I also enjoy hiking (sometimes), napping, waking up late on weekends and binge-watching Netflix on a regular basis.

In my spare time, I develop open source software and academic resources for the [UBC OpenChemE](https://opencheme.github.io/) initiatve. In my other chunk of spare time, I collaborate with UBC researchers and students, including the [BioFoundry](http://www.biofoundry.ca/), the [JJ Feng Group](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~jfeng/) and the [DAIS lab](http://dais.chbe.ubc.ca) on computational engineering and web development [projects](/portfolio).

I like solving challenging technical puzzles. I am most interested in problems at the intersection of chemical and biological engineering, software development and computer science.
