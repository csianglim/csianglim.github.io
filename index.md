I graduated with a degree in [Chemical Engineering](http://chbe.ubc.ca) from UBC Vancouver ([BASc '17](https://apsc.ubc.ca/spotlight/siang-lim)). I'm currently a Process Control Engineer at the [Burnaby Refinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnaby_Refinery). My hobbies include writing [good (-ish) code](https://github.com/csianglim) and drinking excessive volumes of coffee. I also enjoy hiking (sometimes), napping, waking up late and binge-watching Netflix on a regular basis.

In my spare time, I develop open source software and academic resources for the [UBC OpenChemE](https://opencheme.github.io/) initiative. In my recent past, I worked on energy engineering projects at [FortisBC](https://www.fortisbc.com/) and collaborated with UBC researchers, including the [BioFoundry](http://www.biofoundry.ca/), the [MathBio Group](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~jfeng/) and the [DAIS lab](http://dais.chbe.ubc.ca) on computational engineering and web development [projects](/portfolio).

I like working on technical puzzles. I am most interested in challenges at the intersection of chemical & biological engineering, software development and computer science.

My email is [siang@alumni.ubc.ca](mailto: siang@alumni.ubc.ca). I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csianglim/){:target='_blank'} and [GitHub](https://github.com/csianglim){:target='_blank'}.
