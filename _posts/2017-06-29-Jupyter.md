[Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) provides the Canadian research community access to advanced computing resources. Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to create and share reproducible research. In this tutorial, we will show you how to set up a Jupyter Notebook server on the Compute Canada cloud system that you can access remotely. 

### Prerequisites
1. You'll need to apply for a Compute Canada Database [(CCDB) account](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/){:target="_blank"} and get your PI to approve it.

2. Using your CCDB username, you'll need to apply for a separate [Compute Canada Cloud account](https://www.computecanada.ca/create-a-cloud-account/){:target="_blank"}.

3. Once your Cloud account has been approved, you should receive an email and Compute Canada will provide access to either the [West](https://west.cloud.computecanada.ca){:target="_blank"} or the [East](https://east.cloud.computecanada.ca){:target="_blank"} cloud (but not both). 

I spent some time trying to login to the East and West cloud with my CCDB account without applying for a Cloud account, which obviously didn't work. The need to register for a separate Cloud account wasn't very clear to me because the Compute Canada website had the registration link and instructions hidden in the middle of their [Cloud service page](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/national-services/compute-canada-cloud/). 

## Step 1 --- Setting up your Cloud instance
Login to either the [West](https://west.cloud.computecanada.ca){:target="_blank"} or the [East](https://east.cloud.computecanada.ca){:target="_blank"} cloud. Once you're in, you should see a sidebar on the left with a section called **Compute**. We will set up 2 things there, a volume and an instance. 

**Instances** are virtual machines and **volumes** are disk space that can be attached to instances. Data on instances are destroyed when you terminate an instance, but you can store persistent data on volumes. 

### Step 1.1 --- Security
We first need to open up some ports to access the Jupyter Notebook server remotely. In the **Access & Security** tab, click on Manage Rules for the default security group. Click *Add Rule* and add **SSH**, **HTTP**, **HTTPS** and a **Custom TCP Rule** for Port 9999 with direction ingress.

### Step 1.2 --- Volume
In the **Volumes** tab, click on the **Create Volume** button and fill up the name and description. Use **Image** as the Volume Source and **Ubuntu-16.04** as the image source. For the size, anything above **5 GiB** should be sufficient. Use nova for the availability zone.

### Step 1.3 --- Instance
In the **Instances** tab, click on **Launch Instance**. Give it a name and use nova for the availability zone. In **Instance Boot Source** select Boot from volume, then choose the volume that you've just created.

You can select the size of your new virtual machine as pre-defined *flavours*. You have 2 main choices, a **p (persistent)** flavour and a **c (compute)** flavour. Briefly, **c** flavours are intended for running shorter, intensive computations and for development and testing purposes while **p** flavours are meant for running longer computations. You can find more information in the [Compute Canada wiki](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Virtual_machine_flavors){:target="_blank"}.

*__DO NOT CHECK__* the Delete Volume on Instance Delete box or you will lose your data when you terminate the instance.

### Step 1.4 --- Creating an SSH key pair

Under **Access & Security**, select the **default** security group.

Click on the **+** button in the **Key Pair** form to create a new key pair. We will follow the instructions in the new popup window to import a new key pair. Give your key pair a name first, i.e. `Dell Computer`.

If you're on Linux or Mac, open up your terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+T` for Ubuntu) the run the following commands:

Use ssh-keygen to create a key pair named `canadacloud` (you can name it anything you like). It will ask you for a passphrase, just leave it blank if you want.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f canadacloud
```

Grab and copy the public key using this command
```
cat canadacloud.pub
```

Then paste the contents back in the popup window in the **Public Key** box then click the Import button.

Once your done, click **launch** and wait for your instance to boot up. 

#### Step 1.5 --- Associating a Floating IP
To connect to our new instance, we need to assign a public IP to it. In the **Access & Security** tab, select **Floating IPs** and click on **Allocate IP to Project**. Select the default pool and click on the Allocate IP button.

Click on the **Associate** button for the floating IP address and then select your instance in **Port to be associated**. 

## Step 2 --- Installing Anaconda and Jupyter

In your terminal, login to the instance with the following command, replacing `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` with your floating IP address and `computecanada` with your key name.

```
ssh -i computecanada ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

If you're having trouble logging in, try restarting your instance using a soft (or hard) reboot from the dropdown menu in the Instances page. 

First, update your system with the following commands:

```

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

```

Once that's done, download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):

```

wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh 

```

## Step 3 --- Configuring Jupyter Notebook

Once Anaconda is installed, you should be able to launch Jupyter with this command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to close the server.

We will follow the instructions [here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html) to set up Jupyter as a public server and secure it with HTTPS and a password.

### Step 3.1 --- Generate a Jupyter configuration file

First, create a configuration file

```
jupyter notebook --generate-config
```

and generate a hashed password

```
jupyter notebook password
```

### Step 3.2 --- Create an SSL certificate

```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mykey.key -out mycert.pem
```

### Step 3.3 --- Edit the configuration file

First copy your hashed password (the string starting with sha1) with the following command and save it somewhere safe:
```
cat ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.json
```

Open the Jupyter config file in `nano`:

```
nano ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```

Then add the following lines to the top of the file. Replace YourPassword with the password that you copied.
```

c.NotebookApp.certfile = u'/home/ubuntu/mycert.pem'
c.NotebookApp.keyfile = u'/home/ubuntu/mykey.key'
c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'
c.NotebookApp.password = u'YourPassword'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.port = 9999

```

To close and save the file, press `Ctrl+X` and select Yes.

## Step 4 --- Testing your new Notebook

Start the Jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Point your browser to the following address, replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with your floating IP:

```
https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9999/
```

If everything works, you should see a login screen and you will be able to enter your password and login to your Notebook!

## Step 5 --- Persistent Notebooks

Closing your SSH connection will close the notebook server. 

To create a persistent notebook, we will use the [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) terminal multiplexer. First, close the server with `Ctrl+C` then run:

```
screen
```

Then in the new window, run the Jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Now if you close the terminal, the Notebook server will still be running.

## Step 6 --- Conclusion

Congratulations, you should now have a Jupyter Notebook running on the Compute Canada Cloud that you can access remotely. For a quick tour on using Jupyter notebooks, visit [this link](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).


### Notes

If you get an SSL security error in your browser, it's because you're using a self-signed certificate. To get rid of the error, you'll need to use a custom domain and use a **Let's Encrypt** certificate instead of a self-signed certificate:

```

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your.domain.name

```

Then replace the certificate and key in your Jupyter configuration file with the Let's Encrypt certificates

```

c.NotebookApp.certfile = u'/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.name/fullchain.pem'
c.NotebookApp.keyfile = u'/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.name/privkey.pem'

```
